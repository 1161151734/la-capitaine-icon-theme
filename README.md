### What is this?
La Capitaine is a GTK icon pack, designed to integrate with most desktop environments. The set of icons takes inspiration from the latest interations of Mac OS X and Google's Material Design.

Every image in this theme is a _scalable vector graphic_ so it will look great at any size, on any screen. In my spare time, I work on adding new icons, updating old ones, and making this theme more complete. Since this theme is updated often, you should clone this git repository and pull regularly to make sure you're always up-to-date:

    cd ~/.icons
    git clone https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme

### Configuration
La Capitaine comes with a configuration script which attempts to determine your distribution and desktop environment. Using this information, La Capitaine updates several system icons and icons for mime-types.

For best integration with your distro/desktop environment, please run `configure.sh` and follow the prompts.

### Recommendations
La Capitaine looks best with a GTK3 theme based on either Material Design or Mac OS X. Though I don't make GTK+ themes, some of my favourites are: [Flat-Plat](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Flat-Plat?content=167704), [Adapta](https://github.com/tista500/Adapta), [Paper](https://snwh.org/paper/theme), [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), and [Arc-OSX](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Arc-OSX-themes?content=175536). Have fun, and happy theming!

### License
La Capitaine is a fork of the El General icon theme for the GNOME desktop.
El General is in turn a fork of the Numix-circle icon theme.
As such, La Capitaine is a derivative work licensed under the GPLv3; you should have received a copy of this license along with this software.

### Roadmap
To-do:
 * Introduce more icon geometry; the mostly circular base is boring
 * Introduce subtler, softer gradients, lighting, and shadows
 * Change software store and management icons to something more original/generic
